    <h2>DID & Governance</h2>
    <p>Think of your Decentralized Identifier (DID) in Ellipe 3 as your digital passport for the entire ecosystem — a unique and permanent identity that proves who you are without revealing everything about you. When you join Ellipe 3, this passport is created and securely stored by Ellipe 3 Inc. within the decentralized system, ensuring it’s linked to your account and protected by cryptographic keys.</p>
    <p>Even though Ellipe 3 Inc. helps manage the infrastructure, your DID remains under your control. You can connect multiple wallets or devices to this single identity, and if you lose access to one wallet, your identity and history stay safe and recoverable. Ellipe 3 Inc. stores the DID data in a decentralized, encrypted manner on-chain or across trusted storage, safeguarding privacy and preventing unauthorized access.</p>
    <p>This DID passport is essential because it lets Ellipe 3 enforce one-person-one-vote governance — meaning no matter how many wallets you hold, you get exactly one vote. This stops misuse like creating fake accounts or voting multiple times. Ellipe 3 Inc. verifies all votes and actions by matching them cryptographically to your DID, making sure the system remains fair and transparent.</p>
    <p>Moreover, your DID can carry verifiable credentials, like official stamps on a passport, issued by trusted parties. Ellipe 3 Inc. facilitates issuing and managing these credentials securely, allowing you to prove things like eligibility for benefits or regulatory compliance without revealing unnecessary personal details.</p>
    <p>In this way, Ellipe 3 Inc. acts as a guardian of your digital passport’s security and integrity — not as an owner of your identity, but as a steward of the system that respects your privacy and autonomy. Your DID enables you to participate fully and fairly in the Ellipe 3 economy, with confidence that your identity is safe, private, and controlled by you.</p>
