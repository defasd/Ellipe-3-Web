    <h2>Understanding Tokenomics in Ellipe 3</h2>
    <h3>A Two-Token System Built for Stability, Flexibility, and Fairness</h3>
    <p>The tokenomics of Ellipe 3 are designed around one central idea: money should work for the people who create value — not just those who control it. To achieve this, Ellipe 3 introduces a two-token economic system that balances long-term security with short-term usability. This approach ensures that the economy remains stable and inflation-resistant while still being flexible enough to grow and adapt alongside its users.</p>
    <p>At the foundation of this model is the Gold Token, or GT. GT represents real, provable wealth. Each GT token is backed by actual gold reserves, verified through transparent, on-chain proof-of-reserve mechanisms. It acts as a digital version of the gold standard, where every unit of GT is only minted when physical gold has been securely deposited and verified by authorized entities. Because of this, GT is not subject to the type of inflation that weakens fiat currencies. It cannot be created out of thin air. It is designed to hold its value over time, giving users a reliable way to store wealth without worrying about the erosion of purchasing power.</p>
    <p>On top of this stable foundation sits the Standard Token, or ST. ST is used for the day-to-day activity within the Ellipe 3 economy. It is what users spend, earn, stake, and vote with. ST is meant to be flexible and responsive — it can be minted or burned depending on what the network needs. However, this process isn’t random or subject to manipulation. ST supply is always tied directly to the amount of GT that exists in the system. For every GT minted, there is a strict upper limit on how much ST can be in circulation — for example, a 1:20 ratio means that if 1,000 GT exist, no more than 20,000 ST can ever be minted.</p>
    <p>This cap prevents runaway inflation and ensures that the overall value of the system remains connected to real-world assets. ST tokens are minted when economic activity increases — for example, when there is higher demand for transactions or liquidity. Conversely, if activity slows and there is too much ST in circulation, the system automatically burns excess tokens to maintain a healthy supply balance. These decisions are made using real-time data and enforced by smart contracts and oracles — not by centralized actors.</p>
    <p>The relationship between GT and ST creates a unique synergy. GT gives the system its strength — a hard asset that acts as the anchor of value. ST gives the system its motion — a dynamic token that allows for utility, participation, and economic velocity. This combination allows Ellipe 3 to remain stable in uncertain times, while still fostering growth, innovation, and community-led economic decisions.</p>
    <p>What makes Ellipe 3’s tokenomics different from traditional models is that every part of it is tied to user participation. Unlike legacy systems where monetary policy is dictated by banks or governments, here it’s influenced directly by the people. ST holders can vote on proposals that affect how the token is taxed, distributed, or burned. They can shape benefit programs, adjust economic thresholds, and even vote on validator and treasury rules. Every wallet becomes part of the governance layer — meaning your economic voice isn’t limited to how much you own, but also how much you contribute.</p>
    <p>The system also introduces ways to reward active participants. Validators who secure the network earn ST through staking rewards. Users who vote, stake, or contribute to the ecosystem can receive benefits. Businesses that integrate with Ellipe 3 and help circulate tokens may be eligible for subsidies or shared promotions. All of this keeps value flowing through the system and ensures that the people building the economy actually benefit from it.</p>
    <p>Overall, the tokenomics of Ellipe 3 are built not just to function, but to be fair. They are designed to resist inflation, reward contribution, and reflect the true balance of economic activity within the system. By anchoring value in something real and giving control to the users, Ellipe 3 creates a new kind of economy — one that serves the many, not just the few.</p>
